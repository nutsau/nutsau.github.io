CHAOS is a concept store located at 14 M. Kostava Str. in Tbilisi, Georgia. It is a place where Georgia’s youth style tribes go to hang.

The building of Chaos Concept Store used to be an old Soviet publishing house. Large warehouse-style windows and wooden floors create an atmosphere of a 1970s NYC loft. The skate ramp in the corridor, double bed and a ping pong table add to the overall sense that Chaos Concept is not just a concept store but a place for Georgia’s youth to hang out. 

Chaos Concept Store stocks brands from different countries, established as well as upcoming ones. The main criteria for selecting the pieces is the aesthetics: urban, young, striking, a bit rough and alternative, as well as cool and classy. 

The selection of designers and products play a key role. From streetwear to high fashion, from new brands to renowned designers, CHAOS offers a constantly rotating selection on collections and design objects, as well as gift ideas and literary classics.

The significant fact is that Chaos is operating as a platform for music, design, fashion and art. The creators of the store are hosting regular exhibits, readings, concerts and showcases of new works from various designers and artists.
